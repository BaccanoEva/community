Community detection for weighted graphs
=======================================
Input: 
Graph G that we want to identify its communities. See graph.txt as a sample of the input graph style. It's basicall a csv file where each line is represented by a triple such as: 

u,v,w 

The above line basically means that there is an edge between nodes u and v whose weight is w. The lowest id should be zero and the nodes ids increase.

For running this code you need to install NetworkX & Matplolib libraries.
