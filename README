Community detection for weighted graphs
=======================================
Input: 
A weighted graph G. See graph.txt as a sample for the input graph format. It's a csv file where each line has the following format: 

u,v,w 

The above line says that there is an edge between nodes u and v with positive weight w. The lowest id should be zero and the nodes ids increase.

Output:
This code runs Girvan-Newman algorithm and returns a list of detected community with maximum modularity.

Dependencies:
For running the python script you need to install NetworkX & Matplolib libraries.
